🚀 "Unveiling My Latest Data Engineering Endeavor: Real-Time Stock Market Analytics Powered by Apache Kafka!"

🎯 Goal Accomplished: Developed an end-to-end pipeline to streamline real-time stock market data for analytics.

🔧 Tools Used: Apache Kafka, AWS EC2 Instance, Jupyter Notebook, Athena, AWS Crawler, Amazon S3

🚧 Challenge Faced: Struggled with incessant errors while launching Java, Kafka, Zookeeper, and topics onto the EC2 Instance.

💡 Learnings Gained: Gained hands-on experience in stream processing using Kafka on the AWS platform. Launched an Apache Kafka cluster using CLI.

🙏 Project Reference and Support: Huge thanks to Darshil Parmar, Srinivasarao Polisetty, and ChatGPT for putting up with my endless questions.
